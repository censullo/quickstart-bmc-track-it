//[TODO: Shardul] 
As seen in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* A managed internet gateway to direct inbound traffic to a Network Load Balancer.
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnet of Availability Zone 1, an Amazon EC2 instance with Microsoft SQL Server, Track-It!, and BMC Client Management software.
* AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory to provide a fully managed Active Directory domain to which the Track-It! EC2 instance is joined.
* Amazon CloudWatch to monitor, store, and access log files from EC2 instances.
