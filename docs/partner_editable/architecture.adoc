//[TODO: Shardul] 
As seen in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans at least two availability zones
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS
* AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (also known as AWS Managed 
Microsoft AD)
* Amazon CloudWatch for the {partner-product-short-name} instance logs

In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets


//In the private subnets:*

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.
//* 


//*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
