Deploying this Quick Start for a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the AWS Cloud:

//[TODO: Shardul] 
As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans at least two availability zones
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS

In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets


//In the private subnets:*

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.
//* 


//*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.


== Using a registered domain
The {partner-product-short-name} quick start uses a domain name for its HTTPS based end-points. You may choose to use a domain name registered with AWS Route 53. Although, this is an optional step it is recommended for a more secure experience for your users. 

If you choose not to use a AWS Route 53 registered domain name, a random domain name will be generated. However, the certificate associated with this domain name is a self-signed certificate. The default behaviour in web browsers is to not trust such certificates. As a result your users will see a browser warning whenever any web end-point is accessed.

== Microsoft Active Directory
The {partner-product-short-name} quick start deploys a Microsoft Active Directory domain using AWS Directory Service. The DNS and NetBIOS names of the domain can be customized using parameters in the template.
Depending on your requirements you can choose either Standard or Enterprise edition. For more details about these options see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html[AWS Directory Service documentation^].

The {partner-product-short-name} EC2 instance is domain-joined to this domain. 

=== Windows integrated authentication for {partner-product-short-name}
{partner-product-short-name} supports authenticating users with Windows integrated authentication. This is an optional feature. 

In order to have users on your on-premises AD instance authenticate in {partner-product-short-name} successfully, a two-way trust relationship needs to be established between your on-premises AD and the AWS hosted AD instance. For more details about how to enable this see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_connect_existing_infrastructure.html[Connect to your existing AD infrastructure^].


== Sizing
The {partner-product-short-name} quick start deploys an EC2 instance. You can customize the size of this instance depending on your needs. The following table lists the sizes and the instance type. For more details about EC2 instance types see https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/[Amazon EC2 Instance Types^].

|===
|Size |EC2 instance type |Volume size (in GB)

// Space needed to maintain table headers
|Small |m5.xlarge |100
|Medium |m5.2xlarge |150
|Large |m5.2xlarge |300
