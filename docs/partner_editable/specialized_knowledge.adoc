This Quick Start also assumes familiarity with help desk software, Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), and your on-premises Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Office365 accounts. Familiarity with using Amazon Route 53 to register a domain is also recommended.

=== Using a registered domain
This Quick Start deployment uses a domain name for its HTTPS-based endpoints. During deployment, you can enter a domain name registered with Amazon Route 53 and an SSL certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). If you do not, a random domain associated with a self-signed certificate is automatically generated. With a self-signed certificate, browsers display a privacy warning to users attempting to access endpoints.

=== Microsoft Active Directory
The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start deploys an AD domain using AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory (AD). The {partner-product-short-name} EC2 instance is domain-joined to this AD domain. You can customize the DNS and NetBIOS names of the domain during deployment.

You can choose Standard or Enterprise edition of AWS Managed Microsoft AD during deployment. For more information about these options, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html[What is AWS Directory Service?^]

=== Windows integrated authentication
{partner-product-short-name} supports authenticating users with Windows integrated authentication.

You must establish a trusted relationship between your AD and AWS so your existing AD users can be authenticated successfully. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_connect_existing_infrastructure.html[Connect to your existing AD infrastructure^].

=== Sizing
During deployment, you can choose the EC2 instance type to fit your workload. The following table lists the appropriate EC instance types for three use cases.

|===
|Size |Amazon EC2 instance type |Volume size (in GB)

// Space needed to maintain table headers
|Small

Up to five active technicians and up to 100 active requestors. |m5.xlarge |100
|Medium

Up to 15 active technicians and up to 200 active requestors. |m5.2xlarge |150
|Large

More than 15 active technicians and more than 200 active requestors. |m5.2xlarge |300

=== IP Addresses to Whitelist
You may need this if you wish to restrict which users or computers can connect to your {partner-product-short-name} server. There is a configuration option during the setup which allows you to enter a CIDR or range of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to your {partner-product-short-name} server. If you aren’t sure or don’t know, you can always use the default setting and change it later.
