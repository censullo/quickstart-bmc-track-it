This Quick Start assumes familiarity with help desk software, Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), and on-premises Exchange and Office365 accounts. This would also need understanding of Amazon Route 53 for setting up correct DNS entries for the Amazon EC2 instance.

==== Using a registered domain
This Quick Start deployment uses a domain name for its HTTPS-based endpoints. During deployment, you can enter a domain name registered with Amazon Route 53 and an SSL certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). If you do not use an Amazon Route 53 domain, a random domain associated with a self-signed certificate is automatically generated. With a self-signed certificate, browsers display a privacy warning to users attempting to access endpoints.

==== Microsoft Active Directory
The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start deploys an AD domain using AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory (AD). The {partner-product-short-name} EC2 instance is domain-joined to this AD domain. You can customize the DNS and NetBIOS names of the domain during deployment.

Depending on your requirements, you can choose Standard or Enterprise edition of AWS Managed Microsoft AD. For more information about these options, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html[What is AWS Directory Service?^]

===== Windows integrated authentication
{partner-product-short-name} supports authenticating users with Windows integrated authentication. This is an optional feature.

In order to have users on your on-premises AD instance authenticate in {partner-product-short-name} successfully, a two-way trust relationship needs to be established between your on-premises AD and the AWS Managed Microsoft AD. For more details on how to enable this consult the AWS documentation located https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_connect_existing_infrastructure.html[here^].

==== Sizing
The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start deploys an Amazon EC2 instance. You can customize the size of this instance depending on your needs. The following table lists the sizes and the instance type.

For more details on sizing and recommendations consult the {partner-product-short-name} documentation on https://docs.bmc.com/docs/display/trackit2020/Sizing+and+scalability+considerations[Sizing and scalability considerations^].
