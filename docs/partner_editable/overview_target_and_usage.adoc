This Quick Start deployment guide walks you through deploying Track-It! on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud for managing your IT help desk. It is for users who want IT help desk and endpoint management services hosted on the AWS Cloud. 

The Quick Start is deployed on a single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. This instance hosts the database server and the BMC Client Management (BCM) server. After deployment, you must install additional software on your internal network. This will enable BMC Client Management server to discover and audit your on-premises IT infrastructure. For more information, refer to the link:#_post_deployment_steps[Post deployment steps] section later in this guide. To back up the database, you must run scripts on the Amazon EC2 instance that are not part of the default deployment. Create a strategy to back up your database that suits your workflow. If you store the backups on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon S3 Glacier, you can incur additional charges.
