==== Prepare your AWS account

Since the Quick Start deploys an EC2 instance, you need to ensure a Key Pair is available in the region in which you plan to deploy the resources.

==== Prepare your {partner-company-name} account

Sign up for a BMC support profile and license https://community.bmc.com/s/news/aA33n000000Cj6tCAC/creating-a-bmc-support-profile-and-downloading-licensessoftware[here^].

If you donâ€™t have a license, the Quick Start deploys with a trial license. The trial license gives you 90 days of free usage in a non-production environment. After this time, you can upgrade to a production license by following the instructions https://docs.bmc.com/docs/trackit2020/en/applying-a-license-file-912126000.html[here^].

==== Prepare for the deployment

_Describe any preparation required to complete the product build, such as obtaining licenses or placing files in S3_
