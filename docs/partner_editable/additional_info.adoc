// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

== Test the deployment
. After the deployment is completed, you can launch the Technician portal. Check the *Outputs* section of the main stack and navigate to the URL beside the *TrackItTechnicianPortalPublicURL* key.

[#outputs1]
.{partner-product-short-name} Technician portal URL
[link=images/outputs1.png]
image::../images/outputs1.png[outputs1,width=1235,height=502]

[start=2]
. When you launch the application URL for the first time, the *Export Compliance And Access Terms* is displayed. You must accept the terms to access {partner-product-short-name}.

[#export1]
.Export Compliance and Access Terms
[link=images/export_compliance.png]
image::../images/export_compliance.png[export,width=1235,height=502]

[start=3]
. After you click *Continue* on the *Export Compliance And Access Terms* screen, the information is processed by a BMC system for auditing purposes. If it is determined that access cannot be provided, then a message similar to the following message is displayed:

[#export2]
.Export Compliance error
[link=images/export_compliance_error.png]
image::../images/export_compliance_error.png[export_err,width=1235,height=502]

[start=4]
. You must contact BMC Support with the information that is displayed in Figure 4 for assistance.

. If there is no error, the {partner-product-short-name} Technician portal login screen is displayed as shown in the following figure:

== Post deployment steps

=== BMC Client Management Relay server
. To fully leverage the BMC Client Management functionality, you must install the BMC Client Management relay software on one of your on-premises servers. This relay collects information of your on-premises network infrastructure and transmits it to the master server located on the AWS Cloud.

. The relay installation can be downloaded by launching the URL next to the key denoted by *BCMRolloutPublicURL* on the *Outputs* tab of the main stack. 

[#outputs2]
.{partner-product-short-name} BMC Client Management rollout URL 
[link=images/outputs2.png]
image::../images/outputs2.png[outputs1,width=1235,height=502]

[start=3]
. Upon launching the *BCMRolloutPublicURL* in a browser, a warning as shown in the following figure is displayed. This happens because BMC Client Management issues its own certificates. It is safe to continue.

[#rollout1]
.BMC Client Management rollout login warning
[link=images/rollout1.png]
image::../images/rollout1.png[export,width=1235,height=502]

[start=4]
. Upon continuing the following login screen is displayed:

[#rollout2]
.BMC Client Management rollout login page
[link=images/rollout2.png]
image::../images/rollout2.png[export,width=1235,height=502]

[start=5]
. You can login with the BCM admin user credentials to access the rollout download page. 

. Click the _BCM_Agent_Install.exe_ link to download the rollout installation. Then, run the program to complete the installation.
