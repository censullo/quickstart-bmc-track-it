[start=2]
. When you launch the application URL for the first time, the *Export Compliance And Access Terms* is displayed. You must accept the terms to access {partner-product-short-name}.

[#export1]

[start=3]
. After you click *Continue* on the *Export Compliance And Access Terms* screen, the information is processed by a BMC system for auditing purposes. If it is determined that access cannot be provided, then a message similar to the following message is displayed:

[#export2]
