== Post-deployment steps

=== Test the deployment
Test the deployment by accessing the Track It portal.

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation console].
. On the *Stacks* page, choose the stack name.
. On the *Outputs* tab, note the URL in the *Value* column of the  *TrackItTechnicianPortalPublicURL* key.

[#outputs1]
.{partner-product-short-name} Track It Technician Client portal URL

. The Track It login screen displays. The default Track It login credentials for the deployment are *ADMINISTRATOR/password*.

=== Install BMC Client Management relay agent
After deployment, you must install a BMC Client Management relay agent on one of your on-premises Microsoft Windows servers. A relay agent collects and transmits data from your on-premises network infrastructure to the BMC Client Management server on the Track It EC2 instance.

NOTE: These instructions describe a Windows relay agent installation. To install a relay agent on Linux, see https://docs.bmc.com/docs/bcm2008/rolling-out-the-relay-agents-930382510.html[Rolling out the relay agents^].

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation console].
. On the *Stacks* page, choose the stack name.
. On the *Outputs* tab, note the URL in the *Value* column of the *BCMRolloutPublicURL* key.

[#outputs2]
.{partner-product-short-name} BMC Client Management rollout URL 
[link=images/outputs2.png]

[start=4]
. Navigate to the URL.
. A browser privacy warning displays. BMC Client Management uses a self-signed certificate. Choose to continue to the site.
. The BMC Client Management login page displays. Log in with the user name *admin* and the password you entered for the `TrackItBcmAdminPassword` link:#_parameter_reference[parameter] during deployment. 
. On the *Welcome to the Rollout Server Download Page*, choose *BCM_Agent_Install.exe* in the *Auto-extractable Name* column.
. A Windows Defender warning displays. Choose *More info*, then *Run anyway*.
. After the installation is complete, a message stating *The Agent has been installed successfully* displays. Choose *OK*.

=== Install and configure BMC Client Management Console
. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation console].
. On the *Stacks* page, choose the stack name.
. On the *Outputs* tab, note the URL in the *Value* column of the *BCMConsolePublicURL* key.

=== Set relay agent as the scanner
In order to perform discovery of your on-premises devices, additional manual configuration is required. Follow the steps given below.

. From the navigation bar, click *Device Topology* to show the graph of the devices. You should be able to see the server on which the relay agent installed previously. If you don't see it then verify the relay installation.
