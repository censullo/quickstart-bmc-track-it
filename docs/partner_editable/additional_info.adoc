// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

== Test the deployment
// If steps are required to test the deployment, add them here. If not, remove the heading

== Post deployment steps
// If Post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading
Once the deployment is complete you can launch the Technician Portal denoted by the *TrackItTechnicianPortalPublicURL* available on the output pane of the CloudFormation stack. 

=== Export Compliance
Upon launching the application URL for the first time the user will be presented with an Export Compliance Agreement which is required to be accepted . 

[#export1]
.Export Compliance and Access Terms
[link=images/export_compliance.png]

After agreeing to the terms and hitting the continue button this information is processed by a BMC system for auditing purposes. During this process if its determined that you cannot be provided access then a message similar to the following will be displayed.

[#export2]
.Export Compliance error
[link=images/export_compliance_error.png]
image::../images/export_compliance_error.png[export_err,width=648,height=439]

You should reach out to BMC support with this information for more help.

If everything goes well then you should see the {partner-product-short-name} technician portal login screen as seen below.

=== BMC Client Management Relay server
In order to fully leverage the BMC Client Management functionality you need to install the BMC Client Management relay software on one of your on-premises servers. This realy will be responsible for collecting information of your on-premises network infrastructure and will transmit this to the master server located on the AWS cloud.

The relay installation can be accessed via the *BCMRolloutPublicURL* that is available on the CloudFormation output tab. 

Upon launching the *BCMRolloutPublicURL* in a browser a warning such as the following will be displayed. This happens as BMC Client Management issues its own certificates but rest assured that it is safe to continue.

[#rollout2]
