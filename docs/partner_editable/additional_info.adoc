// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

== Post deployment steps
After the deployment is successful, you can launch the Technician portal. The Technician portal is denoted by *TrackItTechnicianPortalPublicURL* and is available on the output pane of the *CloudFormation* stack. 

=== Export Compliance
When you launch the application URL for the first time, the *Export Compliance And Access Terms* is displayed. You must accept the terms to access {partner-product-short-name}.

[#export1]
.Export Compliance and Access Terms

After you click *Continue* on the *Export Compliance And Access Terms* screen, the information is processed by a BMC system for auditing purposes. If we determine that you cannot be provided access, then a message similar to the following message is displayed:

[#export2]
.Export Compliance error
[link=images/export_compliance_error.png]
image::../images/export_compliance_error.png[export_err,width=648,height=439]

You must contact BMC Support with the information that is displayed in Figure 4 for assistance.

If there is no error, the {partner-product-short-name} Technician portal login screen is displayed as shown in the following figure:

=== BMC Client Management Relay server
To fully leverage the BMC Client Management functionality, you must install the BMC Client Management relay software on one of your on-premises servers. This relay collects information of your on-premises network infrastructure and transmits it to the master server located on the AWS Cloud.

The relay installation can be accessed via the *BCMRolloutPublicURL* available on the CloudFormation *output* tab. 

Upon launching the *BCMRolloutPublicURL* in a browser, a warning as shown in the following figure is displayed. This happens because BMC Client Management issues its own certificates. It is safe to continue.

Upon continuing the following login screen is displayed:

[#rollout2]
.BMC Client Management rollout login page
[link=images/rollout2.png]

You can login with the default credentials to access the rollout download page. 

Click the _BCM_Agent_Install.exe_ link to download the rollout installation. Then, run the program to complete the installation.
