{partner-product-short-name} is deployed on a single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. This instance hosts the database server and the BMC Client Management (BCM) master.

In order for the BCM master to discover and audit your on-premises IT infrastructure, additional software needs to be deployed on your internal network. Refer to the link:#_deployment_steps[Deployment steps] for details.

NOTE: To back up the database, you must execute scripts on the Amazon EC2 instance. These scripts are not part of the default image.
You must have a strategy to backup your database that suits your scenario. There can be further costs if you store the backups on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Simple Storage Service Glacier.
