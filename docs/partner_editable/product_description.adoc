{partner-product-short-name} is deployed on a single EC2 instance. This instance hosts the database server and the BMC Client Management (BCM) master.

In order for the BCM master to discover and audit your on-premises IT infrastructure, additional software needs to be deployed on your internal network. Refer to the link:#_deployment_steps[Deployment steps] for details.

NOTE: To back up the database, you must execute scripts on the EC2 instance. These scripts are not part of the default image.
You must have a strategy to backup your database that suits your scenario. There can be further costs if you store the backups on S3 or Glacier.
