{partner-product-short-name} is deployed on a single EC2 instance. This instance hosts the database server as well as the BMC Client Management (BCM) master.

In order for the BCM master to discover and audit your on-premises IT infrastructure, additional software needs to be deployed on your internal network. Refer to the deployment steps for details.

NOTE: Backing up the database requires scripts to be executed on the EC2 instance and are NOT part of the default image. You are responsible for coming up with an appropriate database backup strategy as may be appropriate for your scenario. If you do decide to store the backups on S3 and/or Glacier additional costs may be involved.
